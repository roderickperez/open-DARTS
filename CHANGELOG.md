# 1.1.1 [15-03-2024]

# 1.1.0 [16-02-2024]
- Migrated to cmake build system [(See details)](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/58). We kept the old Visual Studio projects, but they will be removed later.
- Well rates in SuperEngine ("Compositional") are defined in reservoir conditions now, the units are kmol/day
- VTK output unified for all the reservoir classes [(See details)](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/79)
- Discrete Fracture mesh generation tool and model added [(See details)](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/79)
- Windows build script supports optional arguments  [(See details)](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/82)
- Removed python exposures [(See details)](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/74)
- Breaking changes:
    - The function `darts_model run_python()` is renamed to `run()`.
	- Changes in unstructured mesh processing. It is required to specify tags in mesh file for all control elements now  (matrix, fractures and optionally boundary faces). 
	- Changes in vtk output:\
	    {- Before: input properties were saved to the first timestep vtk file -}\
        {+ Now: input properties saved to the separate "mesh.vtk" file +}\
		{- Struct/CPG: DartsModel.export_vtk(file_name, local_cell_data, global_cell_data, vars_data_dtype, export_grid_data) -}\
		{- Unstruct: UnstructReservoir.output_to_vtk(output_directory, output_filename, property_data, ith_step) -}\
        {+ DartsModel.output_to_vtk(ith_step, output_directory, output_properties) +}
	- No need to call `super().set_physics(physics)`, `super().set_reservoir()` and `super().set_physics()` in user's model: \
	    {- reservoir = UnstructReservoir(...) -}\
		{- super().set_reservoir(reservoir)-}\
        {+ self.reservoir = UnstructReservoir(...) +}
	- Discretization moved from the reservoir constructor to `init_reservoir()` method, which is called in `DartsModel.init()`.
	Thus, reservoir.mesh is not available right after the self.reservoir initialization. If it is needed, one can call `self.reservoir.init_reservoir()`. For example:
	```python	
	self.reservoir = StrucReservoir(...)
	self.reservoir.init_reservoir()
	volume = np.array(reservoir.mesh.volume, copy=False)
	# set boundary volume
	m.init()
	```
	- Adding additional properties to the report changed. Examples:\
	{- from darts.physics.super.operator_evaluator import PropertyOperators -}\
	{- props = [('Brine saturation', 'sat', 1), ('Gas saturation', 'sat', 0)] -} \
	{- physics.add_property_operators(PropertyOperators(props, property_container)) -}\
	{+ property_container.output_props = {'Brine saturation': lambda: property_container.sat[1], 'Gas saturation': lambda: property_container.sat[0]} +}
	- `property_container` and `property_container` are now dictionaries with a key=region index. Examples:			  
	{- sat = self.physics.property_operators.property_container.compute_saturation_full(state) -}\
	{- properties = self.physics.vars + self.physics.property_operators.props_name -}\
	{+ sat = self.physics.property_containers[0].compute_saturation_full(state)  # 0 - is a region index +}\
	{+ properties = self.physics.vars + self.physics.property_operators[0].props_name +}
	- The engine object moved to physics (as before, in version 1.0.4):\
	{- m.engine -}\
    {+ m.physics.engine +}

	- Wells object moved to Reservoir :\
	{- m.wells -}\
    {+ m.reservoir.wells +}

		- Now:    physics = Geothermal(...); super().set_physics(physics)  
	- Reservoir initialization:

		- Now:    reservoir = StructReservoir(...); super().set_reservoir(reservoir)  
	- Added method set_wells to the DartsModel class (function with the same name in user's model should be renamed)  
		- Before: set_boundary_conditions() # well controls were here  
		- Now:	rename it to set_wells() and added return super().set_wells() in the end of this method  
	- The 'platform' parameter moved from the engine constructor to set_physics:  
		- Before: Geothermal(..., platform='gpu')  
		- Now:	Geothermal(...); super().set_physics(physics, platform='gpu')
