# openDARTS

[openDARTS](https://darts.citg.tudelft.nl/) is a scalable parallel modeling framework and aims to accelerate the simulation performance while capturing multi-physics processes in geo-engineering fields such as hydrocarbon, geothermal, CO2 sequestration and hydrogen storage.

## Installation

openDARTS with direct linear solvers can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install open-darts
```

openDARTS is available for Python 3.9 to 3.12 for x86_64 architecture both for Linux and Windows. 

To build openDARTS please check the [instructions in our wiki](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/wikis/Build-instructions).

## Tutorials

Check the [tutorial section in the documentation](https://open-darts.gitlab.io/open-darts/getting_started/tutorial.html) and Jupyter Notebooks with basic [Geothermal](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/darts-models/-/tree/main/teaching/EAGE?ref_type=heads) and [GCS](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/darts-models/-/tree/main/teaching/CCS_workshop?ref_type=heads) models.

Also to get started take a look at the different examples in [models](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/tree/development/models?ref_type=heads).

More advanced examples of complex simulations with openDARTS can be found in [open-darts-models](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts-models).
