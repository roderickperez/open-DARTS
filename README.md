[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/open-darts/badge/?version=latest)](https://open-darts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

DARTS is a scalable parallel modeling framework and aims to accelerate the simulation performance while capturing multi-physics processes in geo-engineering fields such as hydrocarbon, geothermal, CO2 sequestration and hydrogen storage.

## Installation

openDARTS is available for Python 3.7 to 3.11.

```bash
pip install open-darts
```
