DARTS is a scalable parallel modeling framework and aims to accelerate the simulation performance while capturing multi-physics processes in geo-engineering fields such as hydrocarbon, geothermal, CO2 sequestration and hydrogen storage.

## Installation

openDARTS is available for Python 3.7 to 3.11.

```bash
pip install open-darts
```

To build openDARTS please check our [wiki](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/wikis/Build-instructions).

## Tutorials
