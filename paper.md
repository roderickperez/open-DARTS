# Summary

> Describe the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.

openDARTS [@openDARTS_2023] is a simulation framework for forward and inverse modelling and uncertainty quantification of multi-physics processes in geo-engineering applications such as geothermal, CO2 sequestration, water pumping, and hydrogen storage.

# Statement of need

> Illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work (other software packages doing similar simulations with references and how is DARTS special. Also list here other software packages that are pertinent to DARTS, for example dependencies, darts-flash?).
