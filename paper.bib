abstract = {A coupled description of flow and thermal-reactive transport is spanning a wide range of scales in space and time, which often introduces a significant complexity for the modelling of such processes. Subsurface reservoir heterogeneity with complex multi-scale features increases the modelling complexity even further. Traditional multiscale techniques are usually focused on the accuracy of the pressure solution and often ignore the transport. Improving the transport solution can however be quite significant for the performance of the simulation, especially in complex applications related to thermal-compositional flow. The use of an Adaptive Mesh Refinement enables the grid to adapt dynamically during the simulation, which facilitates the efficient use of computational resources. This is especially important in applications with thermal flow and transport where the region requires high-resolution calculations as often localized in space. In this work, the aim is to develop an Adaptive Mesh Refinement framework for geothermal reservoir simulation. The approach uses a multi-level connection list and can be applied to fully unstructured grids. The adaptivity of the grid in the developed framework is based on a hierarchical connectivity list. First, the fine-scale model is constructed, which accurately approximates all reservoir heterogeneity. Next, a global flow-based upscaling is applied, where an unstructured partitioning of the original grid is created. Once the full hierarchy of levels is constructed, the simulation is started at the coarsest grid. Grid space refinement criteria is based on the local changes and can be adjusted for specific models and governing physics. The multi-level connectivity lists are redefined at each timestep and used as an input for the next. The developed Adaptive Mesh Refinement framework was implemented in Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator which uses the Operator-Based Linearization technique. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated for several challenging geothermal applications of practical interest.}

abstract = {General purpose reservoir simulation is based on the solution of governing equations describing mass and energy transfer in the subsurface. The solution process requires the linearization of strongly nonlinear governing equations. Usually, a Newton-based method is used for the linearization. This method demands the assembly of Jacobian and residual for a fully coupled system of equations. Recently, a new linearization approach was proposed and tested for binary systems. The key idea of the Operator Based Linearization (OBL) approach is to transform the discretized mass and energy conservation equations to an operator form which separates space-dependent and state-dependent properties of governing equations. This transformation provides the opportunity to approximate the representation of exact physics (physical properties) of a problem. Specifically, each term of the conservation equations is presented as the product of two different operators. The first operator depends on the current physical state of a system and contains fluid properties, such as density, viscosity, relative permeability, etc. The second operator captures both spatially altered properties, such as permeability, and the rest of state variables, such as pressure in the discrete approximation of gradient. All state-dependent operators are uniformly parametrized within the physical space of the problem (pressure-composition intervals). During simulation process, a multi-linear interpolation is applied to approximate the first type of operators, while the second type of operators is processed based on conventional approach. In this work, we extended the approach to thermal systems with an arbitrary number of components. Besides, we significantly improved the performance of OBL employing adaptive parametrization technique. We tested the approach for truly multi-component thermal systems of practical interest. The computational performance, accuracy, and robustness of a new method were demonstrated against the conventional approach.}

The key idea of the approach is the transformation of discretized mass- and energy-conservation equations to an operator form with separate space-dependent and state-dependent components. The state-dependent operators are parameterized using a uniformly distributed mesh in parameter space. Multilinear interpolation is used during simulation for a continuous reconstruction of state-dependent operators that are used in the assembly of the Jacobian and residual of the nonlinear problem. This approach approximates exact physics of a simulation problem, which is similar to an approximate representation of space and time discretization performed in conventional simulation. Maintaining control of the error in approximate physics, we perform an adaptive parameterization to improve the performance and flexibility of the method. In addition, we extend the method to compositional problems with buoyancy. We demonstrate the robustness and convergence of the approach using problems of practical interest.}",

abstract = {In this study, we present an efficient and flexible adjoint-based framework for history matching and forecasting geothermal energy extraction at a large scale. In this framework, we applied the Principal Component Analysis to reduce the parameter space for representing the complex geological model. The adjoint method is implemented for gradient calculation to speed up the history-matching iteration process. Operator-based linearization (OBL) used in this framework makes the calculation of the physical state and its derivatives very efficient and facilitates the matrix assembly in the adjoint method. This study primarily focuses on history matching based on combined observation of well production and in-situ electromagnetic measurements to predict the temperature front. However, different types of misfit terms can be added to the objective function based on practical considerations. For example, our history-matching case studies include model misfit terms applied for regularization purposes. The measurement data is extracted from the true model, and realistic measurement errors are considered. Also, in this work, we propose an optimal weighting strategy for the terms of the objective function to balance their sensitivity with respect to the model control variables. The high efficiency of the framework is demonstrated for the geothermal doublet model implemented at the heterogeneous reservoir with multiple realizations. The framework allows for generating posterior Randomized Maximum Likelihood (RML) estimates of the entire ensemble of the realizations with a reasonable computational cost. Results show that the framework can achieve reliable history-matching results based on the doublets production data and the reservoir electromagnetic measurement.}

It is based on an approximate representation of the exact physics of the problem, which is similar to an approximate representation of space and time discretization performed in conventional simulation. The governing equations are introduced as a combination of operators, dependent on spatially altered properties and operators, fully controlled by nonlinear properties of fluid and rock. Next, a parametrization in the physics space of the problem is introduced. The property-based operators are approximated using direct interpolation in the space of nonlinear unknowns. The discrete version of the governing equations is constructed as a combination of operators that approximate both nonlinear physics and discretization in time and space. This approach is applied to the reservoir simulation of miscible and immiscible displacement processes. The performance of the method demonstrates a convergence of simulation results by resolution in physical space with the improved performance.}
